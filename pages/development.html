  <p>
    All of my node projects use <a href="http://github.com/cliffano/bob">Bob</a> to build. This involves running lint, complexity check, unit tests, tests coverage check, integration tests, and API documentation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Install Bob (once-off, unless you want to upgrade):
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    npm install -g bob
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Do your development, and don't forget to add test(s). Each code change should involve either a new or modified test.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before you commit, build the project from its root directory (same level as package.json):
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    bob build
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    If everything passes, then you can commit and/or push.
  </p>
  <p>
    Less than 100% coverage is currently allowed, but please aim for 100% coverage. I understand that it's painful to cover all error cases but it will pay off, trust me.
  </p>
  <p>
    There's currently no minimum complexity threshold. But please aim for greater than <a href="http://jscomplexity.org/complexity">65</a> on average maintainability.
  </p>
  <p>
    After you push, Travis CI will then kick in to make sure that your fork builds.
